This website was designed, created and developed as part of Start-2-Impact University's Master in Web Development.
It aims at giving a bit of myself, through styles and contents, as well as having people getting to know me.
It took me a bit, both for practical and logistic reasons (I try to cut myself as much time as possible to study and focus on my aspirations, aka waking up at 5am, 5 days out of seven, and study over my lunch break and for another 30 minutes in the evening when I get back at 7pm).
So yeah, I've encountered some bumps and some up-hills, but it's been fun and extremely satisfying seeing it coming to life.
I will accept any feedbacks and hope that you will enjoy it, too.
Sincerely,
Sara
